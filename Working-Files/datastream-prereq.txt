Prepare a Cloud Storage bucket where DataStream will write the event data files. This can be an existing or new bucket created for DataStream.
If you’re writing to a bucket in the same project where you’ll be calling the DataStream API, then enabling the DataStream API is sufficient (no additional steps required).
If you're writing to a bucket in another project, then you must give the service account associated with the DataStream permission to access the bucket.
Obtain the email address used for the service account. To do so, find the Project number in the Cloud Console home page. The email address of the service account will be service-[project_number]@gcp-sa-datastream.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
Grant this email address the required IAM permissions to write to the destination bucket (typically the roles/storage.objectViewer, roles/storage.objectCreator and roles/storage.legacyBucketReader permissions).
